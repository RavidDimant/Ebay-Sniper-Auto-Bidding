## 🔍 Background
I often found myself either **forgetting to place a bid** on items I really wanted, or trying to be **strategically competitive**, only to miss out by a few seconds. This project solves both problems by automatically placing a bid at the perfect moment — without me needing to sit and watch the clock.

I believe this sniper is **safer than other tools** I found online — it does **not store usernames or passwords**, making it more secure for personal use.

More than that, this project was made **for my father**, to help him save time and never miss a bid he truly cares about.
